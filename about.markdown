I'm studying computer science in Wroclaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming. Mostly low level. C, C++, Rust. I also know Python well.
- Hacking. I play ctfs focusing on binary exploitation and reverse engineering.
- Overall just media consumption. Anime, manga, music, video games, cartoons, youtube videos, etc... :)
