Greetings!
I'm Adrian, a programmer interested in exploit development, high-performance computing, operating systems and emulation, among other stuff.
Currently studying computer engineering in Wrocław, Poland.

I play CTF cybersecurity competitions focusing on binary exploitation.
Nowadays you will see me playing with a local polish team [WROng_flag](https://wrongflag.team/). In 2025 we got 48th place on [CTFTime's global ranking](https://ctftime.org/stats/2025/).
In 2023 I was playing with some internet friends as [sillysec](https://ctftime.org/team/268440) where we got 70th place globally.

I'm a member of the scientific circle [PWr WhiteHats](https://whitehats.pwr.edu.pl/).
As a challenge author and co-organizer, I've worked on multiple CTF competitions.
Most notably BreakTheSyntax CTF 2025 and CyberTrust CTF 2025.
Also made some challenges for CyberAdvent WSIZ 2025 and WxMCTF 2024.

Other interests worth listing:
- Free and open-source software. Linux and Emacs <3
- Overall just media consumption. Music, otaku culture, video games, etc.
