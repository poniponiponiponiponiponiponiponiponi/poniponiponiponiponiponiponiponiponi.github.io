Greetings! My name is Adrian and I'm currently studying computer
engineering (in polish: informatyka techniczna) in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming and computer science with a focus on the low-level parts. My goto languages are C, Rust and Python.
- "Hacking". I play CTF competitions focusing on binary exploitation and a little bit of reverse engineering sprinkled there and there.
- Free and open-source software. Linux and Emacs <3
- Overall just media consumption. Music, youtube videos, video games, otaku culture, etc.


Random "achievements":
- [70th worldwide on CTFtime in 2023](https://ctftime.org/team/268440)
I used to play in a team made out of a small group of internet friends.
In 2024 most people in the team got, what for me feels like, burned out
and we don't play anymore, so I'm open to joining other teams, feel
free to contact me.
- Some CTF highlights: 3rd place on [1753CTF
2024](https://ctftime.org/event/2234), 3rd place on [BlueHens CTF
2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2126), 2nd place on [NewportBlakeCTF
2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2072), 3rd place on [AmateursCTF
2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1983). Now to be honest those are
mostly competitions aimed at intermediate people and beginners so
getting high places there isn't really impressive, but... it looks
good on paper.


If you're interested in my personal preferences and why I use the
software I use, [I wrote in detail about it
there](https://poniponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponi.github.io/about/software).
