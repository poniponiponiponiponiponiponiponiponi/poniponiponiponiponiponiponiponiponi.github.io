My name is Adrian and I'm currently studying computer engineering (in polish: informatyka techniczna) in Wroclaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming and computer science with a focus on low-level aspects of it. Mainly C and Rust. I also know (and like!) Python well.
- Free and open-source software. Emacs and Linux are the only things I can see. ;)
- "Hacking". I play CTFs focusing on binary exploitation and a little bit of reverse engineering sprinkled there and there.
- Overall just media consumption. Anime, music, video games, cartoons, youtube videos, visual novels, etc...
