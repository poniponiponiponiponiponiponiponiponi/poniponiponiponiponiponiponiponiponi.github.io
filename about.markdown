My name is Adrian and I'm currently studying computer engineering (in polish: informatyka techniczna) in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming and computer science with a focus on the low-level parts. My fav languages are C, Rust and Python.
- "Hacking". I play CTFs focusing on binary exploitation and a little bit of reverse engineering sprinkled there and there.
- Free and open-source software. Linux and Emacs <3
- Overall just media consumption. Anime, music, video games, youtube videos, visual novels, etc...


Random "achievements":
- [69th worldwide on CTFtime in 2023](https://ctftime.org/team/214211) playing in a team made out of a small group of internet 
friends. In 2024 we wanted to change the team's name from [CVE2K9](https://ctftime.org/team/214211)
to [sillysec](https://ctftime.org/team/268440) but most people in the team got, what feels like, burned out and we rarely play now,
so I'm open to joining other teams, feel free to contact me.
- Some CTF highlights: 3rd place on [1753CTF 2024](https://ctftime.org/event/2234), 3rd place on [BlueHens CTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2126),
2nd place on [NewportBlakeCTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2072), 3rd place on [AmateursCTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1983).
Now to be honest those are mostly competitions aimed at intermediate people and beginners so getting high places there isn't that impressive,
but still... it looks good on paper.
- Somehow got [30th place in day 1 of adventofcode 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/1), lol.


If you're interested in why I use the software I use, [I wrote in detail about it there](https://poniponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponi.github.io/about/software).
