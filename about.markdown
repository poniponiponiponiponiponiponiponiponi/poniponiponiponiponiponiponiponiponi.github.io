Greetings! My name is Adrian and I'm currently studying computer
engineering in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming and computer science with a focus on the low-level parts. My goto languages are C, Rust and Python.
- "Hacking". I play CTF competitions focusing on binary exploitation and a little bit of reverse engineering sprinkled there and there. Nowadays you will see me playing with local polish teams - PWr Synt@x Err0r (as a member of the scientific circle White Hats) and WROng_flag, sometimes LutaNaRyj.
- Free and open-source software. Linux and Emacs <3
- Overall just media consumption. Music, youtube videos, video games, otaku culture, etc.
- Tea c:


Random "achievements":
- [70th worldwide on CTFtime in 2023](https://ctftime.org/team/268440)
I used to play in a team made out of a small group of internet friends.
In 2024 most people in the team got, what for me feels like, burned out
and we don't play anymore.
- Some CTF highlights:
1st place in [pingCTF 2025](https://ctftime.org/event/2670),
3rd place in [1753CTF 2024](https://ctftime.org/event/2234),
3rd place in [BlueHens CTF2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2126),
2nd place in [NewportBlakeCTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/2072),
3rd place in [AmateursCTF 2023](https://ctftime.org/event/1983).

Now to be honest those are mostly competitions aimed at intermediate people or beginners so
getting high places there isn't really impressive, but... it looks
good on paper.


If you're interested in my personal preferences and why I use the
software I use, [I wrote in detail about it
there](https://poniponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponi.github.io/about/software).
