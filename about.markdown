My name is Adrian and I'm currently studying computer engineering (in polish: informatyka techniczna) in Wroclaw, Poland.
My interests include:
- Programming and computer science with a focus on low-level aspects of it. Mainly C and Rust. I also know (and like!) Python well.
- "Hacking". I play CTFs focusing on binary exploitation and a little bit of reverse engineering sprinkled there and there.
- Free and open-source software. Emacs and Linux are the only things I can see.
- Overall just media consumption. Anime, music, video games, cartoons, youtube videos, visual novels, etc...

If you're interested in why I use the software I use, [I wrote in detail about it there](https://poniponiponiponiponiponiponiponiponi.github.io/about/software).
