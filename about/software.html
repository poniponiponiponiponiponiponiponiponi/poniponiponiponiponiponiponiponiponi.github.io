<p>Warning! Opinions below.</p>

<h2 id="emacs-vs-vim-vim-neovim-vi-ed-">Emacs vs Vim (Vim, Neovim, Vi, Ed, …)</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/V3QF1uAvbkU">Emacs</a>! I like the program a little bit
too much so I listed the reasons why below.</p>
<h3 id="the-language">The language</h3>
<p>Lisps are a family of languages I always had a soft spot for and they
seem really cool <em>in theory</em> but outside of Emacs I don’t really have
any use for them. I’m writing a quick and dirty ad-hoc program?
Python. Writing exploits? C and Python. I want to poke at some API or
really any task that is good with dynamic typing? Python. I want to
write software with a good static typing system that is like a
pyramid, very solid but maybe a little stiff? Rust. Things that run in
the browser?  JavaScript. So you could say that Emacs fullfils the
need of writing Lisp inside of me. Vim has Vimscript which everyone
and their mom seems to hate and, thanks to Neovim, Lua which I’m not a
big fan of either (It’s a fine language but it doesn’t get me
excited. The idea of representing everything as a table/tree/whatever
is clever. I said to myself that I’m not gonna mention the indexing
from one because it’s a very surface level thing. <del>And I failed
miserably</del>.).</p>
<h3 id="config-files">Config files</h3>
<p>Topic a little related to the languages but not fully. It’s also
related to how different plugins or packages in the ecosystem handle
configuration. This may say more about myself, but when I used Neovim
in the past, my config always ended up being really, really messy. All
the plugins I used, like LSP support, required me to paste some big
bulk of code into the config file. I never felt like I understood all
the lines, at least without putting effort into it. In Emacs I somehow
ended up having a <strong>two times</strong> smaller config with about the same
functionality (is some ways more, in other less). I almost want to say
three times but I don’t have the numbers anymore and I don’t want to
exaggarate. My config also feels more elegant with about the same
amount of “care” put into it.</p>
<h3 id="keybindings">Keybindings</h3>
<p>I even prefer the keybindings over Vim! I’m not huge on modal editing
like the whole internet seems to be. The constant switching between
normal mode and insert mode is very annoying for me. In a way Vim
users remind me of people who use Caps Lock to capitalize their
letters instead of the superior (!!) shift button. There are the jokes
about the Emacs pinky or horrible Emacs’ shortcuts, however after
rebinding Caps Lock to Ctrl writing is very pleasant.</p>
<h3 id="pluginspackages">Plugins/packages</h3>
<p>For me plugins in both editors are basically the same. All I need is a
LSP client (for which I use Eglot, which is built-in) and Tree-sitter
(which is also built-in). The rest is just sugar on top of it. Some
people will mention Org-mode or Magit as the Emacs’ killer features
but I don’t use them in any way that wouldn’t be possible with some
Vim plugins like Vimwiki or lazygit. Honestly I even think that Neovim
is overall winning in the plugin race. The editor is more popular,
there are many more people writing Lua plugins and reporting bugs than
there are Lisp hackers writing Emacs macros.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad-things-about-emacs">The bad things about Emacs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><del>No proper dap-mode. Well there’s the dap-mode package but it
requires you to use lsp-mode which I don’t like and I don’t want to
be locked in that ecosystem.</del> Seems like there’s
<a href="https://github.com/svaante/dape">Dape</a> now, but I haven’t played
with it yet.</li>
  <li>It can be quite slow on some occasions. It feels great for most of
the time but there are cases where you can feel the garbage
collector. You can feel the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap
buffer</a>. You can feel the
one thread.</li>
  <li>And some other things you could mention. The community being small.
Some dead/junky packages. Startup times. I can’t think of anything
else to be honest.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-vs-helix">… vs Helix</h3>
<p>I like the idea of Helix - having a Vim-like editor with out of the
box human experience. I gain nothing from having a huge config
file. However I don’t trust the developers and the work being done on
Helix is just too slow (which is understandable, this is an
open-source project done without much if any profit, yada,
yada). There are still <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/1151">some problems with syntax highlighting that
haven’t been worked on for
years</a> which I
consider to be basic as far as using the editor goes. Also still no
plugin system in sight which I consider to be essential.</p>

<h3 id="-vs-any-other-editor">… vs any other editor</h3>
<p>At the point of writing this I never really used anything outside of
Vim, Emacs and Helix. I used a little bit of IntelliJ IDEA for a uni
group project but I wasn’t impressed. When I started learning
programming it was Python with the built-in IDLE editor and after that
somehow I moved straight to Vim. I prefer to use true FOSS software
when I have the choice, but if for example a job I’m in will require
me to use VSCode I will not complain (probably!). The only editors I
despise on an ideological level is anything made by JetBrains and
alikes for the predatory tactic of selling the same editor multiple
times for every language they decided to support.</p>

<h2 id="shell">Shell</h2>
<p>Firstly I’m not a fan of Zsh because the defaults there are as bad as
it is possible to make them. Due to this I used fish in the past but
now we have the drawback of having to use a shell language you
probably don’t want to touch cuz you won’t see it anywhere else
anyway, even if it’s a little better than Bash (especially since I
rarely write shell scripts to begin with). That’s why nowadays I
mostly use Eshell with Eat as a terminal emulator inside of Emacs. The
shell has nice integration with Emacs (duh), it uses the completion
package of your choice by default, etc. I also use Bash in the TTY
because that’s the default.</p>

<h2 id="des-vs-wms">DEs vs WMs</h2>
<p>Even though I use i3 myself I believe that tiling window managers are
hugely overrated for most people’s use-cases (It doesn’t mean they
aren’t good! Or even that they aren’t fun to use. Just that their
value is overestimated.) and they only use them because either their
favourite internet celebrity uses them or their friend group does
so. The reason I it is because I want to have an easily configurable
setup, where you have everything in one file you can copy around. I
don’t think there’s much speed to be gained from switching windows a
little faster. I can’t think of a case where I have more than 3
windows open (Emacs, Firefox and Ghidra) that I want to swap around at
the same time. “Alt-tabbing” is more than enough for this. I guess I
use Emacs as my terminal multiplexer and if somebody doesn’t want to
use tmux then using a tiling window manager might be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming languages</h2>
<p>My two main programming languages are Python and Rust. Like I stated
above in the Emacs section, Python is my goto language for anything
where dynamic typing is king. Why not a Lisp? Lisps tend to be a
little dead and realistically in the modern world, where <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5335">programming
stopped being like magic and started being more like
science</a>, where we poke at
different libraries and see what happens, we want our language to be
well supported with a lot libraries, cli tools and other stuff. That
said overall I really like Python, the only thing that I hate about it
is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/964839/">the lack of multistatement
lambdas</a>. In theory there’s a
<a href="https://hylang.org/">Python Lisp dialect</a>, kinda like Clojure but
less serious, and it’s a really cool project however just using Python
is the more pragmantic choice. When it comes to statically typed
languages Rust is my favourite. Everything about it just clicks for
me. The ADTs. The pattern matching. The functional-style programming
combined with low-level concepts. All of the CLI-centric tooling. The
explicitness of the language. It’s a lovely language. I also use C,
though nowadays more and more rarely. I use it sometimes for my
hobbist exploit development stuff, when I just need to do some
syscalls and call it a day. What I like about C is how well it maps to
assembly like no other language. I heard once an argument that it’s
not true because of all the optimizations and while it might be true
in theory, in practice there’s a difference between theory and
practice. If you ever tried to reverse engineer compiled software you
know how much easier it is to do so with a C program than with any
other language.</p>

<p>For debugging I use gdb and ipdb.</p>

<h2 id="x11-vs-wayland">X11 vs Wayland</h2>
<p>I have an AMD GPU and I still use X11. I tried Wayland with Sway and
it felt like torturing myself. I’m gonna give Wayland an another try
but not in the next few years. So what were my problems? I’m sure most
of them have a fix but as a user I live by the philosophy of the least
resistance - I’m gonna use the software that causes the least amount
of friction and allows me to focus on what I want to in the current
moment. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><del>There was some forced VSync kind of problem. All video games that
I wanted to play that are input sensitive were unplayable on Sway.
Even though VSync was turned off in the game settings I had huge
input lag in osu! and Counter Strike that wasn’t present in X11.</del>
Seems like this issue is fixed with the implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/7811">tearing
protocol</a> but it still
isn’t implemented everywhere.</li>
  <li>Fullscreen in video games behaved weirdly.</li>
  <li>Pixelated/blurry (at this point I dont remember to be honest, maybe
both depending on the scale) scaling of things that weren’t made for
Wayland. I have a 3k display in my laptop so scaling is
necessary. It was present for example when using Ghidra.</li>
  <li>Push2talk and screen sharing not working on Discord by default. Not
hard to work around it but it’s better when things just work. ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>And all those problems for what? I heard multiple monitor setups work
better on Wayland. Too bad I use only one.</p>

<h2 id="linux-distributions">Linux distributions</h2>
<p>I don’t have any ‘hot takes’ when It comes Linux
distributions. Honestly I’m fine with anything as long as it doesn’t
get in my way. I prefer Systemd distros because that’s what I’m used
to, it always worked fine and was easy to diagnose with journalctl
(some of the arguments against Systemd seem to be bad
faith). Currently I’m using Arch, I don’t know why but it’s the thing
that works best and if it doesn’t it’s easy to google (or duck it)
why. In the past I used Fedora 38 (or was it 37?) on my laptop and
Fedora 40 on my desktop PC but there were always some small problems
that made me give up on using Fedora as a daily driver. For example
the PCSX2 package at the time of writing this is by default unsuable
beyond a simple launch. First of all it’s a 32-bit package for some
reasons. Secondly, the SPU2 plugin is not found so we can’t even
complete the initial setup. After a little debugging we can see it
happens because we don’t have a 32-bit version of libjack.so.0 and the
plugin needs it.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span>poni@Asuka /usr/lib/games/pcsx2]<span class="nv">$ </span>file libspu2x-2.0.0.so
libspu2x-2.0.0.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 <span class="o">(</span>SYSV<span class="o">)</span>, dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]<span class="o">=</span>ecc8471906cda77ab15e125bc18ad4160f5ad928, stripped

	libjack.so.0 <span class="o">=&gt;</span> not found
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So to fix it we need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo dnf install
jack-audio-connection-kit.i686</code>. This shouldn’t happen and it should
be there as a dependency. I also encountered some weird Wine issues
like a random obscure game crashing on a mov instruction with a memory
address that doesn’t exist, even though it worked fine on Arch. For
the usual complains dnf is slower than it should be, especially after
adding some copr repos. I still like Fedora as a server though. When
it comes to more obscure distros, I tried Guix for a day but after not
being able to install everything I wanted I gave up. Same with
Gentoo - I actually kinda liked it but I used it for a day (or half a
day, the other half was the installation process) and I found the
constant fighting with USEFLAGS to be annoying. I also had a problem
with using rustup on it.</p>
